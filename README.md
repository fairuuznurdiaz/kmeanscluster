# kmeanscluster
This programming will group the data of each province in Indonesia using K-means CLuster ...

The data used is sourced from BPS Publications and publications from the Ministry of Communication and Information in 2021. In this study, the k-means clustering method will be used. K-means clustering is one of the clustering methods that groups data into k-groups based on centroids in each group. In addition, the k-means clustering method is also the most widely used clustering method today, because this method will gradually optimize clustering results which will constantly redistribute targets on observation data to each clustering center to obtain an optimal solution. 
Furthermore, the data obtained will be processed using Python and STATA software to obtain several criteria for determining the optimum number of clusters with a heuristic approach in a data set, namely pseudo-F values, elbow curves and Silhouette values. It says the cluster is formed optimum if the higher the resulting pseudo-F value . In addition to comparing pseudo-F values, we also use the formed elbow curve criteria and the resulting silhouette values. If the curve formed there is a turn / bend on the plot formed, then it can be said that the resulting cluster has been optimum . Whereas, for the silhouette value, it is said that the cluster formed is optimal if the resulting silhouette value is higher or close to the value of one . After evaluation is carried out in the formation of optimum clusters.
